- If you would like to use some of the fonts from here in your projects, it's advisable to always use the latest versions of the font to have access to the new glyphs. For that, we'll always include a `Changelog.md` file for each font folder so you ain't be lost with it.
- We'll always include samples for each font folder for demonstration and give opportunity for third-party to leave useful feedbacks about that specific font or for reporting any mistaken glyph.
- Before using any font, please consult the licensing of each one of them to be clear with the usage policy. For that, we'll always include a `license.txt` for each font folder.
